@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the DMA2D peripheral in Memory-to-Memory transfer
mode. The example is based on the STM32F4xx DMA2D LL API. Peripheral initialization is done 
using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

The example achieves a DMA2D transfer of an internal SRAM static texture array aBufferInput[] 
of size 16x32 and format ARGB4444 (16 bpp) to a destination buffer in internal SRAM in 
array aBufferResult[].
The number of bytes transferred is then 16x32x2=1024 bytes.

Peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

After DMA2D configuration, the data transfer is performed in polling mode and then the transferred 
data are checked in comparing the source and destination buffers aBufferInput[] and aBufferResult[].

STM32F429ZI-Nucleo Rev B board LED1 is used to monitor the transfer status:
- LED1 is ON in case of successful transfer,
- LED1 is blinking in case of transfer error.
