@par Application Description

This application shows how to use the USB host application based on the Audio OUT class on the STM32F4xx devices.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 168 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL. In the High Speed (HS) mode the
USB clock (60 MHz) is driven by the ULPI.

It's worth noting that the system clock (SYSCLK) can be configured, depending on the used USB Core:
 - SYSCLK is set to 168 MHz: for FS Core (FS or HS-IN-FS), because used embedded PHY
                             requires 48 MHz clock, achieved only when system clock
                             is set to 168 MHz.
 - SYSCLK is set to 180 MHz: for only HS Core, since no embedded PHY is used.

When the application is started, the connected USB headset device is detected in AUDIO mode and gets 
initialized. The STM32 MCU behaves as a AUDIO Host, it enumerates the device and extracts VID, PID, 
manufacturer name, Serial no and product name information and displays it on the LCD screen. 

A menu is displayed and the user can select any operation from the menu using the Joystick buttons:
 - "Explore audio file" operation searches for all .Wav files in the uSD and displays it on the LCD screen.
 - "Start audio Player" operation starts playing the song from the uSD. The files are read using the 
   FatFs file system then USBH_AUDIO_ChangeOutBuffer() function is called while playing songs and the
   bytes are stored in a circular buffer. Sampling frequency, Channels number and File size (duration) 
   are detected. The audio.c file contains a set of APIs for Audio Out playback, for example when the 
   WAV file is playing, USBH_AUDIO_SetVolume() is called to change the volume setting. This application does not 
   support compressed WAV formats.
 - "Re-Enumerate" operation performs a new Enumeration of the device.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

For more details about the STM32Cube USB Host library, please refer to UM1720  
"STM32Cube USB Host library".


@par USB Library Configuration

To select the appropriate USB Core to work with, user must add the following macro defines within the
compiler preprocessor (already done in the preconfigured projects provided with this application):
      - "USE_USB_HS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core
      - "USE_USB_FS" when using USB Full Speed (FS) Core 
      - "USE_USB_HS" and "USE_USB_HS_IN_FS" when using USB High Speed (HS) Core in FS mode

It is possible to fine tune needed USB Host features by modifying defines values in USBH configuration
file “usbh_conf.h” available under the project includes directory, in a way to fit the application
requirements, such as:
  - Level of debug: USBH_DEBUG_LEVEL
                  0: No debug messages
                  1: Only User messages are shown
                  2: User and Error messages are shown
                  3: All messages and internal debug messages are shown
   By default debug messages are displayed on the debugger IO terminal; to redirect the Library
   messages on the LCD screen, lcd_log.c driver need to be added to the application sources.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F429xx/STM32F439xx devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324x9I-EVAL RevB 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM324x9I-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Connect a uSD Card,containing .Wav audio file, to the MSD connector (CN17).    
    - Plug the USB headset for sound playback into the STM324x9I-EVAL board through 
      'USB micro A-Male to A-Female' cable to the connector:
      - CN9 : to use USB High Speed (HS)  with embedded PHY(U7)
      - CN14: to use USB Full Speed (FS) 
              Please ensure that jumper JP16 is not fitted.
      - CN15: to use USB HS-IN-FS.
              Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section 2.8 USB OTG2 HS & FS in UM1667

@note  When the uSD Card is used; the Camera module must be unplugged, this is due to
       the shared pins between the two devices.


@par How to use it ?
